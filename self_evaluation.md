# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel pretty confident with the methods I've learned so far and the basic concept of what an array is.  I'll definitely need to keep using methods in order to memorize the basic ones.
# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

Before the next lesson, no.  But I should definitely do this lesson again either tomorrow morning or before bed to solidify the methods and their uses in my head.
# What questions do you have about Arrays?

None so far.  
# Commit your work.

Roger that!
